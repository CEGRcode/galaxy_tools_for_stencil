# galaxy_tools_for_stencil

preprocess tools:

RNA-seq pipeline tools:

1- "rnaseq_tabular_to_nivo_json" tool has the options to generate MA plot and bar plot (based on p-values correspond to each gene) in nivo standard json format. The input can come from deseq2 or cuffdiff tool. 

2- "deseq2_normalized_counts_to_heatmap_nivo_json" generates heatmap of distance between samples based on r-log normalized counts of reads per gene, in nivo standard json format. 

3- "deseq2_pca_plot" generate a PCA plot from the rlog-normalized counts of read per gene data coming out of deseq2 tool 

ChIP-exo pipeline tools:

1- "tagpileup_tabular_to_nivo_json" tool generates Lineplot in nivo standard json format for two groups of sense strand reads and antisense strand reads.

2- "motif_logo_memexml_to_pngs" tool generates meme logos in png format from memexml file. 

3- "resize_4color_plot" tool resize the 4color plot.

4- "scriptmanager_heatmap_add_label" add labels and annotations to the heatmap plot generated by script manager.


tools for POSTing data to Stencil:

1- "post_static_plot_stencil" tool POSTs static images in png format to Stencil

2- "post_nivo_plot_stencil" tool POSTs json files in nivo plot format to Stencil. Supported type of plots are scatterPlot, linePlot and barPlot.
